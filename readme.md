I started this project in 2017 as a way to teach myself web development. The content of this site has changed many times,  even once starting from scratch [(version 1)](https://kennysexton.com/website.v1/index.html).  I visit this site every so often to update content as well as make improvements to the way content is delivered.

## Lazy Loading

The website uses lazy loading avoid performance problems caused from the heavy network demand of loading many photos.  The gallery will first load a spinner to keep the page responsive.

Once all page content is loaded, then the browser will begin swapping the spinner with the appropriate photo.  This process happens fast enough that it is unnoticeable on most network connections.
